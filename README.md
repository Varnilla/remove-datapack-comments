# What It Does ‚ùì
What the program does or how it works is by looping through every files in the choosen Minecraft Datapack Folder, then modify its content: removing space and comments.

# How To Use It
1. Download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you haven't already.
2. Download this repository (or just the `index.js` file if you want, its fine.)
4. Make a backup of your datapack folder, it's optional but just incase the code messed with your datapack.
5. Move `index.js` inside your datapack folder (alongside `pack.mcmeta`)
6. Run `node .` in the terminal inside your datapack folder.
7. Every comments and spaces are now gone from your mcfunctions, making it a lot more clean, and saves up an EXTREMELY small amount of spaces.

Yes. I don't know why I made this in the first place. Seem a bit pointless but sometimes I use it for personal use.
